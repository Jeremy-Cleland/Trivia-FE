Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:
What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Eli: Committed and dedicated to figuring out whatever needs to be done
Brandon: Worked with authorization and APIs before, as well as JavaScript
Jeremy: Past experience working with APIs, CSS
Adrienne: I enjoy CSS, communication, a commitment to learning what’s needed to get the job done
How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project? We can help walk each other through pieces we might be more familiar with, communicate throughout the process and hopefully strengthen areas of weakness through tackling the parts we’re less comfortable with

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Adrienne: The craft competency
Brandon: The results competency
Eli: The quality competency
Jeremy: The craft competency
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work? Pair programming throughout but dividing up pieces if we run into time constraints and need to each tackle individual parts

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises? Communication

Being open to each other’s ideas and input as well as feedback. If communication is not effective, we will reach out to Audrey for guidance

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Speak up and articulate our concerns. Also be honest if we are confused about pieces and hesitant to jump in because of that.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Communicate and an itinerary for how to move forward. Speak up and ask for help if needed.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? Respectfully and tactfully address the concerns and articulate areas the team feels the individual needs to jump in more.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
We will bring it to Audrey’s attention after we’ve first tried to address it amongst our group.

Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
Describe at least:

What hours will you be available to communicate?
Whenever but we will be mindful of those on the eastern time zone

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Slack

How often will you take breaks? Every hour and then a lunch

What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Put in the extra work to get caught up

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? Slack

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? Have stand-up style meetings in the morning to discuss ideas, concerns, and questions and utilize tools like Trello

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? By not interrupting, being receptive to people’s input and being respectful to one another

Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Utilize Trello to assign tasks/cards, stay in communication but also pair program throughout
What project management tool will be used? Trello, Miro

Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
Describe at least:

What components of your project will live on GitHub? All of our repos

How will you share the repository with your teammates? We will all be part of the same organization

What is your Git flow? Work on individual branches, merge to dev branch and have a protected main branch for deployment

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

How many people must review a PR? 2

Who merges PRs? Whoever as long as they’re approved

How often will you merge? As needed

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? Slack each other or discuss if we’re together
